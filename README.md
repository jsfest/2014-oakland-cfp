# JSFest Oakland CFP

Call for proposals for all speakers and events at JSFest Oakland. To submit a proposal, please open a new Github issue. If you'd prefer, you can also submit a proposal by emailing [jsfest-oakland-organizers@tenconf.com](mailto:jsfest-oakland-organizers@tenconf.com).

# Speak at JSFest

Many JSFest events are accepting talks. You can propose a talk that you'd like to give at any event or suggest a specific event you'd like the talk to be considered for.

## Speaker Perks

You will receive one free all access ticket for all of JSFest. If you live outside the bay area we can also offer a $400 accomodation stipend and a flight stipend of $500 for domestic speakers and $1000 for international speakers.

If your employer is willing to cover the cost of your attendance we can offer a modified version of our "Basic" sponsorship in return. 

Speakers who accept a stipend are asked kindly to refrain from promoting their employer during their talk.

## Talk Acceptance

All talks are still being considered. Talks will be accepted one at a time over the next few months. Because many events are structured in a narrative acceptance happens in the order we fill the narrative.

**You should still submit your talk! We are definitely still accepting them :)**

## Events

* **NodeConf ONE-SHOT** Single day node conference
* **Hapi Days** Single day [hapi.js](http://hapijs.com) event

### Submissions

Create an issue in this repository. You can suggest a talk you'd like to give or one that you would like to see with or without a suggested speaker.

The idea doesn't have to be fully fleshed out and we're here to help.

### Format & Audience

Talks are 20 minutes. There is no time for Q&A after.

All events with speakers are presented as part of a *narrative*. Don't worry about fitting your talk in to specific narrative, that's the job of the curator, and we may add new narratives based on the proposals we get.

JSFest is designed to be accessible. Talks should be targetted at new to intermediate skill levels.

### What makes a good talk

Don't talk about **a** technology, tell the story of what you **did** with that technology.

Nobody ever left a conference talk with enough information in their head to write a program from what they learned. For obvious practical reasons people learn and continue to follow documentation while writing software. Don't try to teach people what is already in the documentation, tell them a story that makes them care enough to follow up with that technology.
